First, execute

$ ./config.sh

Then, execute  
  
$ ./create.sh source  
  
to create the source file "build/amp4hef.f03" which can be compiled to  
make the Fortran module "amp4hef" available. If you do not want to use  
the script, you must compile the separate source files yourself in the  
order as given inside the script. Execute create.sh without arguments
to get more information. 
  
The Fortran module "amp4hef" provides the parameter  
  
  integer,parameter :: fltknd=kind(1d0)  
  
which is set to this value at the beginning of the module  
"amp4hef_qomentum". All real and complex variables are of this kind.  
  
The Fortran module "amp4hef" provides the following routines defined in  
the file "amp4hef_main.f03":  
  

  subroutine put_process( id ,Ntotal ,Noffshell ,process )  
    integer,intent(out) :: id
    integer,intent(in ) :: Noffshell,Nonshell,process(*)
!
!   Ntotal is the total number of partons in the process
! Noffshel is the number of off-shell partons. The off-shell partons
!          are none, the first, or the first two.
! process  has size at least "Ntotal", and encodes the process. So for example
! the process "g* q -> q g g" is represented as "0 -> g* q~ q g g" putting
!   Ntotal=5 ,Noffshell=1 ,process(1:5)=[0,-1,1,0,0]
! the process "q* g -> q g g" is represented as "0 -> q~* g q g g" putting
!   Ntotal=5 ,Noffshell=1 ,process(1:5)=[-1,0,1,0,0]
! The output "id" is an integer identificator for the initialized process.
  

  subroutine put_momenta( id ,momenta ,directions )  
    integer     ,intent(in) :: id
    real(fltknd),intent(in) :: momenta(0:3,*) ,directions(0:3,*)
!
! The size of the second dimension of the input "momenta" should be at  
! least "Ntotal". If "Noffshell=2", then the first two entries,
! "momenta(0:3,1)" and "momenta(0:3,2)", should contain the off-shell
! momenta. If "Noffshell=1", then the first entry of "momenta" should
! contain the off-shell momentum. The other entries should be on-shell.
! The sum of the momenta should vanish, so they should all be incomming,
! or outgoing.  
! The size of the second dimension of the input "directions" should be  
! at least "Noffshell". These "Noffshell" entries should contain the  
! longitudinal momentum components of the off-shell momenta, as in  
!   gluon 1 off-shell: momenta(0:3,1) = directions(0:3,1) + kT(0:3,1)  
!   gluon 2 off-shell: momenta(0:3,2) = directions(0:3,2) + kT(0:3,2)  
  

  subroutine matrix_element_a( id ,rslt )  
    integer     ,intent(in ) :: id
    real(fltknd),intent(out) :: rslt  
!
! should be called after subroutine "put_momenta" and returns the  
! amplitude squared and summed over colors and helicities for the values  
! of the momenta given to "put_momenta".  
! The result of this routine is missing a factor  
!   "(4*pi*alpha_strong)^(Ntotal-2)"
! The number of colors is fixed to the value 3. Have a look in the file
! "amp4hef_aux.f03" if you would like to change this.
  

  subroutine matrix_element_b( id ,rslt )  
    integer     ,intent(in ) :: id
    real(fltknd),intent(out) :: rslt
!
! The same as "matrix_element_a", but including factors for the average
! over initial-state colors, and the final-state symmetry factor.
  

  subroutine amplitude( id ,rslt ,helicity ,permutation )  
    integer        ,intent(in ) :: id
    complex(fltknd),intent(out) :: rslt  
    integer        ,intent(in ) :: helicity(*)  
    integer        ,intent(in ) :: permutation(*)  
!
! can be called several times after "put_momenta" for different values
! of the input "helicity" and "permutation".
! The first entries of "helicity" refer to the on-shell gluons.
! If there is a q-qBar pair, then the next helicity refers to the quark.
! The anti-quark automatically gets the opposite helicity of the quark.
! If the quark is off-shell, then the helicity refers to the opposite
! of the helicity of the anti-quark.
! If there are only gluons, then "perm(1:Ntotal-2)" permutes the last
! "Ntotal" gluons. If there is a q-qBar pair, it permutates the gluons.
! The normalization of the amplitudes is such that
!   A(1-,2+,3-,4+) = <13>^4 / (<12><23><34><41>)
! and
!   A(1*,2+,3-,4+) = <p1|3>^4 / (<p1|2><23><34><4|p1>) / kappa1*
! where "momentum1 = p1 + kT1"


EXAMPLE:
An example of use of "amp4hef" can be found in the directory "example".
Have a look at the file "example/src/main.f03". It constitutes a Monte
Carlo program to evaluate the cross section for a number of processes.
The event generation is simulated by reading event files.
The directory "example_cpp" contains a similar example of use in C++.
