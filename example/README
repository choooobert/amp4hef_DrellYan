 Example of use of "amp4hef" in a Monte Carlo program. Have a look at
 the file "src/main.f03". It constitutes a Monte Carlo program to
 evaluate the cross section for a number of processes. The event
 generation is simulated by reading event files.

 To execute the program, choose your Fortran compiler at the beginning
 of the file "run.sh", and execute

 $ ./run.sh datafiles/gs_gs_3g.evt

 Instead of "gs_gs_3g.evt", you can choose any other file in the
 directory "datafiles".
